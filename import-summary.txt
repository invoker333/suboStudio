ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard\
* proguard\dump.txt
* proguard\mapping.txt
* proguard\seeds.txt
* proguard\usage.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In UnZip:
* src\ => unZip\src\main\java\
In subo:
* AndroidManifest.xml => subo\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => subo\src\main\assets\
* libs\android-support-v13.jar => subo\libs\android-support-v13.jar
* libs\baidu_cuid.jar => subo\libs\baidu_cuid.jar
* libs\BaiduAppX_V2.4.0_20160317.jar => subo\libs\BaiduAppX_V2.4.0_20160317.jar
* lint.xml => subo\lint.xml
* proguard-project.txt => subo\proguard-project.txt
* res\ => subo\src\main\res\
* src\ => subo\src\main\java\
* emplacement.WAV => emplacement.wav

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
